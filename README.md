# Building Better API Clients in Swift

Talk given at [Twilio Signal 2016][1]. PDF of the slides can be found
[here][2].

What are the best practices for building API clients in Swift? In this talk we will learn:

- how to make API clients adapt to change more gracefully using Hypermedia 
- how to make APIs more accessible with interactive playgrounds and comprehensive documentation 
- how to use code generation to bring the advantages of type safety to clients for more dynamic APIs 
- how to set our tooling to ensure quality goals are met with every release.

Live coding will be used throughout.
